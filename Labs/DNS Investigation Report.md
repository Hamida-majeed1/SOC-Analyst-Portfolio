# DNS Investigation Report

## Title

DNS Investigation Using `nslookup`

## Objective

The objective of this investigation is to understand how the Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name into an IP address using the `nslookup` command.

## Tools Used

* Windows Command Prompt (CMD)
* `nslookup` Command

## Command Used

```cmd
nslookup google.com
```

##  Output
Server:  [Hidden]
Address: [Hidden]

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: google.com
Addresses: 142.250.xx.xx


> **Note:** The IP address may vary depending on your network, DNS server, and geographic location.

## Investigation Process

1. Opened Command Prompt.
2. Executed the command `nslookup google.com`.
3. Observed the DNS server information.
4. Verified that the domain name was successfully resolved into an IP address.
5. Recorded the results.

## Findings

* **Domain Name:** google.com
* **DNS Server:** Local DNS server (example: 192.168.1.1)
* **Record Type:** A Record (IPv4 Address)
* **Result:** The domain name was successfully translated into an IP address.

## Analysis

DNS is responsible for converting human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use for communication. When the `nslookup` command is executed, the computer sends a DNS query to the configured DNS server. The DNS server responds with the corresponding IP address, allowing the browser or application to connect to the correct web server.

## Importance in Cybersecurity

DNS investigation helps security analysts to:

* Verify domain name resolution.
* Detect suspicious or malicious domains.
* Investigate phishing websites.
* Troubleshoot DNS-related issues.
* Identify incorrect DNS configurations.

## Conclusion

The investigation confirmed that the DNS server successfully resolved the domain name **google.com** into an IP address. This demonstrates how DNS enables users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of numeric IP addresses. Understanding DNS investigation is an essential skill for SOC Analysts and cybersecurity professionals.

## Commands Practiced

```cmd
